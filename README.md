# gcapi
Gcapi (Global Currencies API) is a simple library linked to a Currencylayer website account.

## About
This API aims to get related currency value you need to know.
Following your Currencylayer account, the interval between two global currencies refresh could take an hour.
Gcapi is only a layer over original Currencylayer API.

### Status
In progress... first version soon.

## More
Given that gcapi would only return a result like an object or a json file to parse,
you have a repository which use this API to convert live currencies between themself.
You can find and clone it from my repositories => LSCC.
